## :scroll: Description
Adopt Happily is an Android Jetpack Compose App for finding cute dogs in neighborhood of San Francisco up for adoption.
The UI is built entirely in Compose, with hardcoded data.


## :bulb: Motivation and Context
* My First time ever writing an app UI with Jetpack Compose
* Incorporated the __Navigation Component__ for going from list screen to detail.
* Supports Light & Dark Mode.
* Supports Portrait and landscape mode.
* Architecture is scalable to get data from an api or local database due to Repository Pattern.
